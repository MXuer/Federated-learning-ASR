# Federated-learning-ASR

In this repository you will find the codes used to generate the results for our ITG 2021 publication.
The espnet and kaldi codes are in the corresponding subdirectories. They run independent from each other.
We uploaded our code modifications and some parts of the underlying systems, but not the complete frameworks, because they can be found by their corresponding authors' git repositories.

- ![https://github.com/mravanelli/pytorch-kaldi](https://github.com/mravanelli/pytorch-kaldi)
- ![https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi)
- ![https://github.com/espnet/espnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet)

Please make sure, that you provide the missing components in the correct folders, e.g. the complete pytorch-kaldi source codes in the folder with the same name.
The same needs to be done with the espnet sources.
